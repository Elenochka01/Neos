### Project Description
This project consists of a simple Selenium automation script in Java. Due to time constraints, the implementation is basic but functional. The script automates the process of testing the "Join Our Team" section. The **Thread.sleep** method was used only for visual validation to ensure that every step is clearly visible in the recorded video. The video is also attachedâ€”please check it out.

### 1.Dropdown Menu Test:
- The user navigates to the **"Join Our Team"** section.
- Verifies that the dropdown menu is clickable.
- Confirms that it redirects to the correct pages.
### 2.Employee Benefit Booklet Test:
- Checks if the **"Employee Benefit Booklet 2025"** link is clickable.
- Ensures it opens in a new window.
### 3.Final Steps:
- The script returns to the main page.
- Closes the website.
